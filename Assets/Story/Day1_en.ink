Day 1 Morning #character:Narration #place:5 #style:blackscreen
Sweetie, will you sell the first drink of your opening to me? #character:wunv #place:2 #sound:BGM1 #track:2
A sensual and unrestrained dancer sits on a walnut chair, with red velvet tassels draped over her slender belly, the white jade embellishing the tassels blends with her fair skin. #character:Narration #place:5 #style:Default
+It's unexpected and an honor to have you visit my shop. #character:protagonist #place:4

+[About the town]
    --(aboutTown)
    ++I often heard about this town back in the capital city. #character:protagonist
        What did they tell you? #character:wunv
        Rivers of fine wine, endless singing and dancing, travelers elbowing their way through, bread soaked in the scent of milk? #character:wunv
        You nod involuntarily, your thoughts drifting to those glorious times. #character:Narration
        And... #character:protagonist
        But those days are long gone. The town used to be bigger, more prosperous, and livelier. Then, as the caravans took different routes, everything changed. #character:wunv
        Luxurious inns were left vacant, fine wines undrunk, and once the water source dries up, there will be nothing left here at all. #character:wunv
        You look at the dancer with a heavy heart, surprised. #character:Narration
        Ah? Is it that serious? #character:protagonist
        Just kidding, by the time the water source dries up, your grandchildren's grandchildren will have grandchildren. #character:wunv
        The dancer watches the young man's expression, enjoying the outcome of her jest. #character:Narration
        -> aboutTown
    ++[About town news]
        {I heard the town's blacksmith secretly met with the vinegar shopkeeper's wife, and the cosmetic shop owner said the blacksmith even bought some perfume as a gift for her. | The town's butcher recently found a box of gold ingots, flaunting it proudly, dining lavishly in my guild hall, making quite the fool of himself. | The desert surrounds our town, but it's not barren. A few years ago, a drunken villager claimed to have seen a wolf haggling over a bottle of wine with a fox outside the town in an abandoned temple, though it was probably just his drunken illusion.} #character:wunv
        -> aboutTown
    ++[About the town's nobility]
        The current ruler of the town is a noblewoman. Her grandfather saved the Hami leader from wild beasts decades ago. Out of gratitude, the leader bestowed this town to him as a reward. A few years ago, the old noble passed away, and his only granddaughter inherited the title. #character:wunv

    ++ [I have no more questions]
        -> Wunv
+May I get you anything else? #character:protagonist
    I have a friend coming over for a gathering this afternoon. Please arrange it. #character:wunv
    The dancer leaves the inn, walking into the desolate streets, while you clean up the cups and plates, pondering who this mysterious friend of hers could be.#character:Narration

Day 1 Noon #character:Narration #place:5 #style:blackscreen #Back:wunv
The door is knocked loudly, and a beggar with tattered clothes stands at the entrance holding a bowl. #character:Narration #style:Default
Boss, may your fortune soar and luck be with you! #character:qigai #place:2
The beggar says, walking into the shop on his own. #character:Narration
A beggar, dressed in rags, holding a wine gourd in his hand. #character:Narration
+Sir, may you live a long life as well. #character:protagonist
    Remembering some unwritten rules from the capital city, you treat the beggar with a certain level of respect and, following the etiquette of the capital city, give him a pancake and some copper coins. #character:Narration
    The beggar devours the pancake but doesn't even glance at the copper coins. Instead, he pulls out a shiny gold ingot from his bosom. #character:Narration
    Bring me a pot of your signature drink. #character:qigai
    ++[Asking about the signature drink]
        Sir, what signature drink are you referring to? #character:protagonist
       

 The fine wine personally brewed by the Western Regions' master, available only in your shop, don't you know? #character:qigai
        I too admired the master's reputation and traveled here from afar to open this inn, but by the time I arrived, it was all ruins. Could it be that the master's true legacy is still hidden here? #character:protagonist
        What a pity! What a pity! I tasted it once when I was young #character:qigai
        It was the most delicious wine, truly, truly liquid gold! It seems now it exists only in my memories! #character:qigai
        The beggar gets up and leaves on his own after speaking. #character:Narration
    --
    ++Please go safely. #character:protagonist
        Hearing you speak, the beggar seems to remember something, pulling out a small key from his dirty, torn pocket and giving it to you. #character:Narration
        "When I was young, I stored a lot of wine here. If you can find the cellar where the wine is stored, maybe this key can unlock it and bring the master's fine wine back to light." #character:qigai
        ->Afternoon
    
*Go away, beggar! #character:protagonist
    The beggar gives you a look, leaves, but when you come back to your senses, you find a lot of money missing from the counter. #character:Narration
->Afternoon

=== Afternoon ===
Day 1 Afternoon #character:Narration #place:5 #style:blackscreen #Back:qigai 
In the afternoon, while preparing in the kitchen, you hear a scream, so you rush to the front hall to check. #character:Narration #style:Default
Just reaching the corridor, you see a huge rat scurry past you. Arriving at the front hall, you find a woman dressed as a constable trembling on top of the dancer. #character:Narration

*The rat has been chased away. #character:protagonist
*Here's the spice wine you ordered (pretending nothing happened). #character:protagonist
*To think a constable would be afraid of rats? #character:protagonist
-
The female constable realizes someone is there and gets up from the dancer, putting on a stern face and sitting beside her. #character:bukuai

*Do you have any orders for me, ma'am? #character:protagonist
*A little silver as a token of my respect (bribing). #character:protagonist

-
The female constable looks at you for a long time before finally speaking. #character:bukuai
You can't run a shop here. #character:bukuai

*What...? I haven't violated any laws. #character:protagonist
-

The dancer glances at the female constable. #character:Narration
"Forgive my sister for her abrupt words; she didn't mean that. Pour yourself a drink, and let's talk while we eat." #character:wunv #place:3

*Why can't I run a shop here? #character:protagonist

-
The female constable looks at you, her expression cold. #character:Narration
To be exact, you can open a business anywhere in this town except for this inn." #character:bukuai

*Is there something wrong with this inn? Although there are rats, I will take care of them. #character:protagonist
-

Hearing the word "rats," the female constable stiffens up a bit, unconsciously starts drinking to calm herself, while the dancer reluctantly takes over the conversation. #character:Narration
She's trying to protect you. You're an outsider, it's understandable that you don't know, but this place, it's haunted! #character:wunv

*[About the haunting]
-
This building has been unoccupied for a long time, but sometimes people walking at night hear footsteps inside, and sometimes even the sound of things being smashed! #character:wunv
The female constable drinks to herself. #character:Narration

*[About the ghost's origin]
-

Ah, it's a pity to say, three years ago, a female pearl merchant came here, when this place was already deserted. To save on accommodation, she stayed here, but who knew that a night watchman heard a scream at night and found her killed by a female ghost in bed! #character:wunv
The female constable drinks. #character:Narration

*How can you be sure it was a ghost? #character:protagonist
-

The watchman immediately reported it to the authorities, and the constables arrived swiftly, but they found the merchant's belongings and even her

 clothes intact, yet the body mysteriously disappeared. #character:wunv
To this day, it has not been found. Tell me, isn't this the work of a ghost? #character:wunv
The female constable drinks another cup, then slumps over the table, overwhelmed by alcohol. #character:Narration

*Ma'am, are you okay? #character:protagonist
-

The dancer sniffs the constable's cup. #character:Narration
Ah, she mistakenly drank my strong liquor in her panic, no wonder she got drunk so quickly. #character:wunv
The female constable grabs your hand as you reach out to help her up, then chuckles. #character:Narration
When did such a good-looking sweetie come to town? Let your sister have a good look at you. #character:bukuai
The dancer pulls back the female constable, stopping her from getting too close. #character:Narration
You're drunk, he's the new chef in town, planning to run the inn left by the master... #character:wunv
The inn left by the master, no! Absolutely not! #character:bukuai

*Is the inn really haunted? #character:protagonist
-

Haunted? Hicâ€”Nonsense. #character:bukuai
There are no ghosts in this world! Nor fox spirits! #character:bukuai
It's all lies told by charlatans! What happened in this inn was a murder... case. #character:bukuai
A murder case? #character:protagonist
Yes! Want to know about it? #character:bukuai
Can you tell me? #character:protagonist
My drink's gone, pour me another! #character:bukuai

*[About the murder case.]
-

Although the merchant's valuables were untouched, all her possessions together weren't worth much. #character:bukuai
Weren't there a lot of pearls? #character:protagonist
Most of those pearls were fake or of low quality, put them all together, and they wouldn't buy a pretty dress! #character:bukuai
So, the merchant was a fraudster? Could it be the killer killed her out of anger upon discovering she had no money? #character:protagonist
The female constable smiles proudly. #character:Narration
Sweetie, cooking is your forte, but catching thieves is mine. #character:bukuai
This person had neither a merchant guild's invitation nor any buyer's contact information, which clearly shows the 'pearl merchant' identity was just a cover! She never intended to sell those fake goods! #character:bukuai
The female constable looks drowsy. #character:Narration

*So what you're saying is... #character:protagonist
-

Actually, I was there when the case happened. I found a pile of ashes in the fireplace. Given the hot weather, there was no need to light a fire, so I suspected those ashes. #character:bukuai
In the end, my effort paid off, and I found a piece of paper in the ashes that wasn't completely burnt. It said there was gold buried in this building! #character:bukuai
So, I concluded it was a murder case motivated by money. #character:bukuai
But this happened three years ago, right? #character:protagonist
Yes, but in these three years, there's been no news of a large amount of old gold appearing in the area, so I believe the murderer hasn't succeeded yet, definitely lurking in some dark corner. #character:bukuai
I'm worried you might encounter danger running a shop here. #character:bukuai
Also, I've identified a suspect, who is right here in our town, it's... it's... zzz... #character:bukuai
The dancer pushes the constable, shakes her head, indicating she's completely passed out. #character:Narration
You watch the dancer carry away the drunk constable, pondering over the murder case mentioned by the constable. #character:Narration
